Guess the hidden word!

Each series of underlined dashes represents a letter of the hidden word.

To suggest a letter, simply click on one of the on-screen keys.

If the hidden word contains the suggested letter, the hidden letter(s) will be revealed above the appropriate stroke(s).

If the hidden word does not contain the suggested letter, the player loses a life.

The game ends when the player successfully reveals the hidden word or when they run out of lives.
